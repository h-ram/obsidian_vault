### **Affine Transformation:**
An affine transformation is a function that preserves points, straight lines, and planes. It is a combination of linear transformations (like rotation, scaling, and shearing) and translations (shifting).
Mathematically, an affine transformation in $\mathbb{R}^2$ (2D space) can be expressed as:
$$y=Ax+b$$
- y is the transformed point.
- A is a linear transformation matrix (it can represent scaling, rotation, shearing, etc.).
- x is the original point.
- b is a translation vector (it shifts the entire space).

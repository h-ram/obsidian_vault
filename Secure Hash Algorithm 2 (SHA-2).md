#cryptography 

SHA-2 is a family of hash functions designed by the **[[National Security Agency (NSA)|NSA]]** and published by **[[National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)|NIST]]** in **2001** as an improvement over [[Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1)|SHA-1]]. It produces hash values of different lengths, making it more secure and resistant to attacks.

# **SHA-2 Variants**
SHA-2 includes several algorithms, each producing a different hash size:
- **SHA-224** → 224-bit hash (28-byte output) → 56 hex characters
- **[[Secure Hash Algorithm - 256 (SHA-256)|SHA-256]]** → 256-bit hash (32-byte output) → 64 hex characters
- **SHA-384** → 384-bit hash (48-byte output) → 96 hex characters
- **SHA-512** → 512-bit hash (64-byte output) → 128 hex characters
- **SHA-512/224** → 224-bit output using SHA-512 computations→ 56 hex characters
- **SHA-512/256** → 256-bit output using SHA-512 computations → 64 hex characters
Among these, **SHA-256 and SHA-512** are the most commonly used.

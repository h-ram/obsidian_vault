An **HTTP response** is a message sent by the server back to the client after processing an [[HTTP Request]]. It contains the result of the server's action (whether itâ€™s returning requested content, an error message, or redirecting to another resource). An Example:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html 
Content-Length: 45

- [[#Response Status Codes]]
---
An HTTP response is composed of 3 main parts:
1. **Response Line**: it contains 3 components:
	1. **HTTP Version**
	2. **Status Code**: A 3-digit code indicating the result of the request
	3. **Status Message**: A short description of the status code (e.g., "OK", "Not Found").
2. **[[HTTP Headers|Reponse Headers]]**: key-value pairs that provide metadata about the message.
3. **Response Body**: The **body** of the response contains the actual data sent from the server to the client. This could be:
	- **HTML content** (for a web page),
	- **JSON or XML** (for API responses),
	- **Binary data** (like images, PDFs, etc.),
	- **Plain text**.

First-order logic (FOL), also known as predicate logic, extends [[Propositional Logic]] by incorporating **quantifiers** (e.g., ∀ for "for all" and ∃ for "there exists") and **predicates** that can express relationships between objects. It deals with objects, their properties, and relationships, allowing more expressive reasoning. For example:
- Propositional logic: P ("It rains").
- First-order logic: $\forall x (Human(x) \rightarrow Mortal(x))$ ("All humans are mortal").
FOL is widely used in mathematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence.

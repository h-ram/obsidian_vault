A cybersecurity solution is a set of tools, technologies, and practices designed to protect systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. These solutions can include:
1. **Firewalls** – Monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
2. **Antivirus & Anti-Malware** – Detect and remove malicious software.
3. **Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)** – Identify and block threats in real-time.
4. **Endpoint Security** – Protect devices like computers and smartphones from cyber threats.
5. **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** – Ensure only authorized users can access systems.
6. **Encryption** – Secure data by converting it into unreadable formats.
7. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** – Analyze security logs for threat detection.
8. **Penetration Testing Tools** – Identify vulnerabilities in networks and applications.

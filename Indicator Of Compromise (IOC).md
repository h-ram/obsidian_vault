**IOC** refers to pieces of forensic data, or artifacts, that suggest a security breach or cyberattack has occurred. These indicators can be used by security professionals to identify malicious activity in systems, networks, or applications.

**Example of an IOC**
- **IP Address**: `192.168.1.100` (associated with a known attacker)
- **File Hash**: `a3c8d9e4c8f8c8b90ff85d4dbf44619b` (representing a known malware file)
- **URL**: `http://maliciouswebsite.com`
### Types of IOCs
1. **File Hashes**: A unique signature (like MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256) of a known malicious file.
2. **IP Addresses**: Malicious or suspicious IP addresses that may be associated with an attacker.
3. **URLs or Domains**: Web addresses or domains linked to phishing sites or command-and-control servers.
4. **Email Addresses**: Addresses used by attackers in phishing or spamming activities.
5. **Registry Keys**: Changes in system registry settings that indicate malware activity.
6. **Network Traffic Patterns**: Unusual communication patterns or connections to known malicious sources.

The name **"Zettelkasten"** comes from the German words _"Zettel"_ (meaning "slip of paper" or "note") and _"Kasten"_ (meaning "box" or "container"). Together, it translates to **"slip box"**, reflecting its original form as a physical system for organizing and storing ideas or notes on individual pieces of paper within a box. Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten consisted of thousands of interlinked index paper cards (slips), he called it "his Zettelkasten".

A **MitM attack** is when an **attacker secretly intercepts** and **possibly alters** the communication between two parties (e.g., a user and a website, or two servers). The attacker effectively places themselves between the two legitimate entities without either of them knowing, allowing them to **eavesdrop**, **steal information**, or **tamper with the data** being exchanged.
### **Common Types MITM Attacks:**
* **[[Packet Sniffing]]:** Attackers capture unencrypted data on a network to steal sensitive information like passwords.
- **[[Session Hijacking]]**:Attackers steal session cookies to take over an active login session and impersonate the user.
- **[[DNS Spoofing]]**:Attackers redirect users to fake websites by sending false DNS responses, poisoning the victim's DNS cache.
- **[[SSL Stripping]]**: Attackers downgrade secure HTTPS connections to unprotected HTTP, allowing them to intercept and read the data.

#cryptography 

Hashing is converting a piece of data into a fixed-length string (hash value or digest) for the purpose of identification.

# Hashing Algorithms
- **[[Message Digest 5 (MD5)|MD5]]** (obsolete due to vulnerabilities)
- **[[Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) |SHA-1]]** (weak, no longer recommended)
- **[[Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) |SHA-2]]** (widely used, secure)
- **[[bcrypt]], Argon2, PBKDF2** (used for password hashing with added security)

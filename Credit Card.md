#finance 

- **What it is**: A card that lets you **borrow money** from the bank or card issuer to make payments.
- **How it works**:
    - You can spend up to a credit limit (e.g., $1,000), and you’ll pay the bank back later.
    - If you don’t pay the full balance by the due date, you’ll be charged interest.
- **Best for**: Building credit, making large purchases, or emergencies.

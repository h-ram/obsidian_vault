SSL stripping is an attack where the attacker **downgrades** a secure HTTPS connection to an unencrypted HTTP connection, allowing them to intercept and view sensitive data.

**Example:**  
Youâ€™re trying to access a banking website over HTTPS, but the attacker intercepts the connection and forces it to use HTTP instead. Now, your login credentials and sensitive information are sent over an unprotected connection, allowing the attacker to steal them without you knowing.

**Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that allows a user to connect to another computer remotely over a network or the internet. It provides a graphical interface to access and control the remote system as if the user were physically present.

# **How RDP Works**
RDP operates on a client-server model:
- The **RDP client** (your local computer) initiates a connection to the **RDP server** (the remote computer).
- The remote machine **processes input** (keyboard, mouse) from the client.
- The remote desktop interface is **compressed, encrypted, and transmitted** over the network.
- The client **renders the interface** on its screen, allowing interaction.
RDP uses **port 3389** (by default) for communication, which can be changed for security reasons.

# **RDP Components**
- **RDP Client (Remote Desktop Connection - `mstsc.exe`)**
    - Built into Windows (Start → Run → `mstsc`).
    - Available for macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
- **RDP Server (Remote Desktop Services - RDS)**
    - Included in Windows Server editions for multiple users.
    - Windows 10/11 Pro and Enterprise support single-user RDP.

# **RDP vs. Other Remote Access Technologies**

| Feature            | RDP                        | VNC                    | SSH (X11 Forwarding)    | TeamViewer/AnyDesk    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Protocol**       | RDP (Microsoft)            | RFB (open-source)      | Secure Shell (SSH)      | Proprietary           |
| **Performance**    | Optimized for Windows      | Slower (pixel-based)   | Limited to command-line | Fast & efficient      |
| **Security**       | TLS, NLA                   | No built-in encryption | Strong encryption       | End-to-end            |
| **Multi-user**     | Supported (Windows Server) | Not supported          | Not applicable          | One session           |
| **Cross-Platform** | Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS | Windows, macOS, Linux  | Unix-based systems      | Windows, macOS, Linux |

# **Alternative Remote Access Tools**
If RDP is not available or practical, consider:
- **Microsoft Remote Desktop App** (For macOS, iOS, and Android)
- **AnyDesk** (Fast, lightweight remote access)
- **TeamViewer** (User-friendly, supports cross-platform access)
- **Chrome Remote Desktop** (Google Chrome-based access)

A **DNS resolver** is a server that helps convert domain names (like `example.com`) into IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`). This process is called **DNS resolution**. The resolver acts as an intermediary between a user's device and the DNS system, ensuring that the device can reach the correct server when a website or service is requested.
### How It Works:
1. **User Request**: When you enter a domain name in your browser (e.g., `www.example.com`), your computer asks a DNS resolver to find the IP address for that domain.
2. **Querying DNS Servers**: If the resolver doesn't already know the answer, it will send requests to other DNS servers to look up the IP address. This typically involves:
    
    - **Root DNS servers**: They know where to find the authoritative servers for top-level domains (e.g., `.com`).
    - **TLD DNS servers**: These know where to find the authoritative servers for a specific domain (e.g., `example.com`).
    - **Authoritative DNS servers**: These hold the actual records for the domain and provide the correct IP address.
3. **Response**: Once the resolver gets the correct IP address, it sends it back to your computer so your browser can connect to the website.
### Example:
1. **You type `www.example.com` in your browser**.
2. Your computer asks your DNS resolver, "What's the IP address of `www.example.com`?"
3. If the DNS resolver doesn't know, it asks other DNS servers to help find it, starting from the root servers, then TLD servers, and finally the authoritative server for `example.com`.
4. The authoritative server responds with the IP address (e.g., `192.0.2.1`).
5. Your computer receives the IP and uses it to connect to the `www.example.com` website.
### Recursive vs. Iterative Resolution:
- **Recursive Resolver**: The DNS resolver performs all the steps to find the IP address and returns the final answer to your device.
- **Iterative Resolver**: The resolver only queries one DNS server at a time and provides partial answers. It relies on the next DNS server to continue the process.
Resolvers are typically operated by ISPs, but you can also use public resolvers like Google's (`8.8.8.8`) or Cloudflare's (`1.1.1.1`).

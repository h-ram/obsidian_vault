**homograph attack** is where an attacker exploits **characters from different scripts** that look visually similar or identical to deceive users into believing they are visiting a legitimate website. This is typically done by registering domain names that look identical to those of popular websites, but which contain characters from different alphabets (such as Cyrillic, Greek, or other non-Latin scripts).

### **Apriori Algorithm - Step-by-Step Explanation**
---
The **Apriori algorithm** is a popular method in data mining used to identify frequent itemsets in a dataset and derive association rules. It is primarily used for market basket analysis, helping to discover relationships between items purchased together.

---
### **Key Concepts**
1. **Support**:
    - The fraction of transactions in the dataset that contain an itemset.
    Support(Itemset)=Number of transactions containing the itemsetTotal number of transactions\text{Support(Itemset)} = \frac{\text{Number of transactions containing the itemset}}{\text{Total number of transactions}}
2. **Confidence**:
    - Measures how often an association rule holds true.
    Confidence(A → B)=Support(A ∪ B)Support(A)\text{Confidence(A → B)} = \frac{\text{Support(A ∪ B)}}{\text{Support(A)}}
3. **Lift**:
    - Measures how much more likely BB is purchased when AA is purchased compared to random chance.
    Lift(A → B)=Confidence(A → B)Support(B)\text{Lift(A → B)} = \frac{\text{Confidence(A → B)}}{\text{Support(B)}}
4. **Frequent Itemsets**:
    - Itemsets that meet or exceed a user-defined **minimum support threshold**.
5. **Association Rule**:
    - An implication of the form A→BA \to B, where AA and BB are itemsets.
---
### **Steps of the Apriori Algorithm**
#### **Step 1: Generate Candidate Itemsets**
Start by identifying all possible **1-itemsets** (sets with one item). Count their occurrences and calculate their support. Retain only those that meet the **minimum support threshold**.

#### **Step 2: Generate Frequent Itemsets**

- Use the **Apriori property**, which states:
    
    - If an itemset is frequent, all its subsets must also be frequent.
    - Conversely, if an itemset is infrequent, all its supersets are also infrequent.
- Generate kk-itemsets by joining frequent (k−1)(k-1)-itemsets and pruning itemsets containing any infrequent subset.
    

#### **Step 3: Repeat Until No More Frequent Itemsets**

Continue generating kk-itemsets until no more frequent itemsets can be identified.

#### **Step 4: Generate Association Rules**

For each frequent itemset:

- Derive rules A→BA \to B where AA and BB are subsets of the itemset.
- Calculate the **confidence** of each rule.
- Retain rules that meet the **minimum confidence threshold**.

### **Detailed Example**

#### **Dataset**:

We have 5 transactions:

|Transaction ID|Items Purchased|
|---|---|
|T1|{Milk, Bread, Butter}|
|T2|{Milk, Bread}|
|T3|{Milk, Butter}|
|T4|{Bread}|
|T5|{Milk, Bread, Butter}|

#### **Parameters**:

- **Minimum Support Threshold**: 40% (0.4)
- **Minimum Confidence Threshold**: 70% (0.7)

---

#### **Step 1: Generate 1-Itemsets**

1. Count occurrences of each item:
    
    - Milk: 4
    - Bread: 4
    - Butter: 3
2. Calculate support for each item:
    
    Support(Milk)=45=0.8\text{Support(Milk)} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 Support(Bread)=45=0.8\text{Support(Bread)} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 Support(Butter)=35=0.6\text{Support(Butter)} = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6
3. Retain items meeting the **minimum support threshold** (0.4):
    
    - {Milk},{Bread},{Butter}\{Milk\}, \{Bread\}, \{Butter\}

---

#### **Step 2: Generate 2-Itemsets**

1. Combine frequent 1-itemsets:
    
    - {Milk,Bread},{Milk,Butter},{Bread,Butter}\{Milk, Bread\}, \{Milk, Butter\}, \{Bread, Butter\}
2. Count occurrences and calculate support:
    
    - {Milk,Bread}\{Milk, Bread\}: 3 (Support = 3/5=0.63/5 = 0.6)
    - {Milk,Butter}\{Milk, Butter\}: 3 (Support = 3/5=0.63/5 = 0.6)
    - {Bread,Butter}\{Bread, Butter\}: 2 (Support = 2/5=0.42/5 = 0.4)
3. Retain frequent 2-itemsets:
    
    - {Milk,Bread},{Milk,Butter},{Bread,Butter}\{Milk, Bread\}, \{Milk, Butter\}, \{Bread, Butter\}

---

#### **Step 3: Generate 3-Itemsets**

1. Combine frequent 2-itemsets:
    
    - {Milk,Bread,Butter}\{Milk, Bread, Butter\}
2. Count occurrences and calculate support:
    
    - {Milk,Bread,Butter}\{Milk, Bread, Butter\}: 2 (Support = 2/5=0.42/5 = 0.4)
3. Retain frequent 3-itemsets:
    
    - {Milk,Bread,Butter}\{Milk, Bread, Butter\}

---

#### **Step 4: Generate Association Rules**

1. For each frequent itemset, derive possible rules and calculate confidence.
    
    - From {Milk,Bread}\{Milk, Bread\}:
        
        - Milk → Bread:Confidence=Support(Milk, Bread)Support(Milk)=0.60.8=0.75\text{Milk → Bread}: \text{Confidence} = \frac{\text{Support(Milk, Bread)}}{\text{Support(Milk)}} = \frac{0.6}{0.8} = 0.75
        - Bread → Milk:Confidence=Support(Milk, Bread)Support(Bread)=0.60.8=0.75\text{Bread → Milk}: \text{Confidence} = \frac{\text{Support(Milk, Bread)}}{\text{Support(Bread)}} = \frac{0.6}{0.8} = 0.75
    - From {Milk,Butter}\{Milk, Butter\}:
        
        - Milk → Butter:Confidence=Support(Milk, Butter)Support(Milk)=0.60.8=0.75\text{Milk → Butter}: \text{Confidence} = \frac{\text{Support(Milk, Butter)}}{\text{Support(Milk)}} = \frac{0.6}{0.8} = 0.75
        - Butter → Milk:Confidence=Support(Milk, Butter)Support(Butter)=0.60.6=1.0\text{Butter → Milk}: \text{Confidence} = \frac{\text{Support(Milk, Butter)}}{\text{Support(Butter)}} = \frac{0.6}{0.6} = 1.0
    - From {Bread,Butter}\{Bread, Butter\}:
        
        - Bread → Butter:Confidence=Support(Bread, Butter)Support(Bread)=0.40.8=0.5\text{Bread → Butter}: \text{Confidence} = \frac{\text{Support(Bread, Butter)}}{\text{Support(Bread)}} = \frac{0.4}{0.8} = 0.5
        - (This rule does not meet the minimum confidence threshold.)
    - From {Milk,Bread,Butter}\{Milk, Bread, Butter\}:
        
        - Milk, Bread → Butter:Confidence=Support(Milk, Bread, Butter)Support(Milk, Bread)=0.40.6=0.67\text{Milk, Bread → Butter}: \text{Confidence} = \frac{\text{Support(Milk, Bread, Butter)}}{\text{Support(Milk, Bread)}} = \frac{0.4}{0.6} = 0.67 (Rule rejected.)

---

### **Final Association Rules**

1. Milk → Bread (Confidence = 0.75)\text{Milk → Bread (Confidence = 0.75)}
2. Bread → Milk (Confidence = 0.75)\text{Bread → Milk (Confidence = 0.75)}
3. Milk → Butter (Confidence = 0.75)\text{Milk → Butter (Confidence = 0.75)}
4. Butter → Milk (Confidence = 1.0)\text{Butter → Milk (Confidence = 1.0)}

1. **Frequent itemsets** identify groups of items often purchased together.

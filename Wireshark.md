Wireshark is a **network protocol analyzer** that captures and inspects network packets in real time.
Wireshark is often compared to a **"sniffer"**, as it allows users to "see" the data being transmitted over a network, including source and destination addresses, protocols used, and even payload data if itâ€™s not encrypted.

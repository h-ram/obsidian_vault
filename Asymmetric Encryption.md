Also known as public-key cryptography, is ==a cryptographic method that uses two different keys: a **public key** for encryption and a **private key** for decryption.==
Some Popular Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms
1. **[[Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)]] (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**
2. **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**
3. **DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)**
4. **ElGamal**
5. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**

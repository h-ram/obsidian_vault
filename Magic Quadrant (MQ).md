### **Magic Quadrant Structure**
The Magic Quadrant is a **2x2 matrix** that categorizes vendors into four quadrants based on two key factors:
1. **Ability to Execute** (Y-Axis) – Measures the vendor's ability to deliver products, services, and customer satisfaction.
2. **Completeness of Vision** (X-Axis) – Assesses the vendor’s innovation, market understanding, and future plans.
The quadrants are:
1. **Leaders** (Top Right) – Strong execution and a clear vision for the future.
    - **Example**: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud (for cloud computing).
2. **Challengers** (Top Left) – Strong execution but a less innovative or evolving vision.
    - **Example**: Oracle Cloud, IBM Cloud.
3. **Visionaries** (Bottom Right) – Innovative but may struggle with execution or market adoption.
    - **Example**: Alibaba Cloud, Snowflake (for data warehousing).
4. **Niche Players** (Bottom Left) – Focused on specific markets or use cases but lack broad execution or vision.
    - **Example**: DigitalOcean, Linode (for cloud hosting).

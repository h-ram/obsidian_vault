#cryptography 

A cryptographic method where ==the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.==
Some Symmetric Encryption Algorithms: 
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Widely used, secure, and efficient.
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: Older, insecure due to small key size (56-bit).
- **3DES (Triple DES)**: Enhanced DES, but slower and being phased out.
- **Blowfish/Twofish**: Flexible key sizes, often used in embedded systems.
- **RC4**: Simple but outdated due to vulnerabilities.
- **ChaCha20**: Modern, fast, and secure stream cipher.

Being able to protect data and a system without negativly affecting an organization's business. (e.g too many security checks slows the flow of work) . To achieve this, organizations must follow a process called the `risk management process`. This process involves the following five steps:

| Step                     | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 1.`Identifying the Risk` | Identifying risks the business is exposed to, such as legal, environmental, market, regulatory, and other types of risks.                                                                 |
| 2. `Analyze the Risk`    | Analyzing the risks to determine their impact and probability. The risks should be mapped to the organization's various policies, procedures, and business processes.                     |
| 3. `Evaluate the Risk`   | Evaluating, ranking, and prioritizing risks. Then, the organization must decide to accept (unavoidable), avoid (change plans), control (mitigate), or transfer risk (insure).             |
| 4. `Dealing with Risk`   | Eliminating or containing the risks as best as possible. This is handled by interfacing directly with the stakeholders for the system or process that the risk is associated with.        |
| 5. `Monitoring Risk`     | All risks must be constantly monitored. Risks should be constantly monitored for any situational changes that could change their impact score, `i.e., from low to medium or high impact`. |

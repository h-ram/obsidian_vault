## **Cloud Deployment Models**
(Based on Where the Cloud is Hosted)
1. **Public Cloud**
    - Owned and operated by third-party providers, accessible to anyone over the internet.
    - **Example**: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS.
    - **Use Case**: Hosting a companyâ€™s website without managing hardware.
2. **Private Cloud**
    - Infrastructure dedicated to a single organization, hosted either on-premises or by a third-party provider.
    - **Example**: A bank maintaining its private cloud for secure transactions.
    - **Use Case**: Organizations with strict security and compliance needs (e.g., government agencies).
3. **Hybrid Cloud**
    - A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them.
    - **Example**: A retail company using a private cloud for customer data storage and a public cloud for handling website traffic.
    - **Use Case**: Businesses needing both security and flexibility.
4. **Multi-Cloud** (cross-cloud)
    - Using services from multiple cloud providers to avoid vendor lock-in and enhance redundancy.
    - **Example**: A company running its web application on AWS but using Google Cloud for AI processing.
    - **Use Case**: Businesses seeking reliability and best-of-breed solutions.

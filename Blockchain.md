#cryptocurrency

At its core, a blockchain is a **chain of blocks**, where:
	- **Block**: A collection of data (e.g., transactions, records) stored together.
- **Chain**: The blocks are linked sequentially in a way that ensures their integrity and security.

The blockchain acts as a database that no single entity owns, meaning no central authority (like a bank) controls it. Instead, it's **distributed** across a network of participants, making it secure and transparent.

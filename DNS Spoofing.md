DNS spoofing (or DNS cache poisoning) is when an attacker sends **fake** DNS responses to a victim’s DNS resolver. This **corrupts** the victim’s DNS cache and redirects them to malicious websites, instead of the legitimate ones they intend to visit.

**Example:**  
You try to visit `www.bank.com`, but the attacker has poisoned your DNS cache. Instead, you’re redirected to a fake website that looks exactly like your bank’s website. The attacker can then steal your login credentials or personal information.

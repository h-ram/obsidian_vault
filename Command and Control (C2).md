**Command and Control (C2)** refers to how the attackers remotely communicate with and control compromised systems, such as infected computers in a **[[Botnet]]** or malware-infected devices.
### **Common C2 Communication Methods**:
- **HTTP/HTTPS** – C2 traffic disguised as normal web traffic.
- **DNS Tunneling** – Using DNS queries to send/receive hidden data.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)** – Botnets communicating without a central server.
- **Social Media & Cloud Services** – Commands hidden in social media posts or cloud storage.

A **file system** is the method an operating system (OS) uses to store, retrieve, and manage data on a disk or storage device. Different file systems offer various features like **performance, security, journaling, compatibility, and reliability**.

## **1. Common File Systems and Their Differences**

|**File System**|**OS Compatibility**|**Journaling**|**Max File Size**|**Max Volume Size**|**Best For**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**FAT32**|Windows, macOS, Linux|No|4GB|2TB|USB drives, older devices|
|**exFAT**|Windows, macOS, Linux (with drivers)|No|16EB|128PB|Large USB drives, SD cards|
|**NTFS**|Windows, Linux (read-only by default), macOS (read-only)|Yes|16EB|8PB|Windows OS, internal drives|
|**EXT4**|Linux only|Yes|16TB|1EB|Linux OS, modern Linux file storage|
|**XFS**|Linux|Yes|8EB|8EB|Large-scale storage, high performance|
|**Btrfs**|Linux|Yes (Copy-on-Write)|16EB|16EB|Advanced Linux storage (RAID, snapshots)|
|**ZFS**|Linux, FreeBSD|Yes (Copy-on-Write)|16EB|256ZB|Enterprise storage, data integrity|
|**APFS**|macOS, iOS|Yes|8EB|8EB|macOS SSDs, encryption, snapshots|
|**HFS+**|macOS (older)|Yes|8EB|8EB|Older macOS systems, external drives|

## **2. Key Features of File Systems**
### **1. Journaling**
- A journaling file system keeps a log of changes before writing them to disk.
- Prevents corruption after crashes.
- Examples: **NTFS, EXT4, XFS, APFS, Btrfs, ZFS**.
### **2. Maximum File & Volume Size**
- **FAT32** limits files to **4GB** (not good for large media files).
- **exFAT, NTFS, EXT4, and others** allow much larger file sizes.
### **3. Compatibility**
- **FAT32 & exFAT** work on nearly all devices but lack journaling.
- **NTFS** is best for Windows but **read-only** on macOS.
- **EXT4, XFS, Btrfs** are for **Linux**.
- **APFS & HFS+** are for **macOS**.
### **4. Copy-on-Write (COW)**
- **Btrfs & ZFS** use **COW**, meaning data is written to a new location before replacing the old data. This helps prevent corruption.
### **5. RAID & Snapshot Support**
- **Btrfs & ZFS** support built-in **RAID, snapshots, and self-healing**.
- Other file systems need external tools for these features.

| **Windows OS Drive**                 | **NTFS**                             |
| **Linux OS Drive**                   | **EXT4**                             |
| **macOS OS Drive**                   | **APFS**                             |
| **Large Media Storage**              | **exFAT, XFS, or NTFS**              |
| **RAID & Enterprise Storage**        | **ZFS or Btrfs**                     |
| **High-Speed Database Systems**      | **XFS**                              |

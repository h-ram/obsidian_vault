Packet sniffing is when an attacker uses special tools to **monitor** and **capture** unencrypted data traveling across a network, allowing the attacker to access sensitive information like passwords, emails, and credit card details.

**Example:**  
Youâ€™re using a coffee shop Wi-Fi, and while browsing, you enter your email and password on a website. A hacker using a packet-sniffing tool can capture the unencrypted data, steal your login credentials, and use them to access your accounts.

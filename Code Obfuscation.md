Obfuscation is a technique used to make a script more difficult to read by humans but allows it to function the same from a technical point of view.
```js
// Example Code
console.log('HTB JavaScript Deobfuscation Module');

// Obfuscated Code
eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d){e=function(c){return c};if(!''.replace(/^/,String)){while(c--){d[c]=k[c]||c}k=[function(e){return d[e]}];e=function(){return'\\w+'};c=1};while(c--){if(k[c]){p=p.replace(new RegExp('\\b'+e(c)+'\\b','g'),k[c])}}return p}('5.4(\'3 2 1 0\');',6,6,'Module|Deobfuscation|JavaScript|HTB|log|console'.split('|'),0,{}))
```

### **Packing**
An obfuscation technique recognized by the six argument function `function(p,a,c,k,e,d)`it usually attempts to convert all words and symbols of the code into a list or a dictionary and then refer to them using the `(p,a,c,k,e,d)` function to re-build the original code during execution. The `(p,a,c,k,e,d)` can be different from one packer to another. However, it usually contains a certain order in which the words and symbols of the original code were packed to know how to order them during execution.

While a packer does a great job reducing the code's readability, we can still see its main strings written in cleartext, which may reveal some of its functionality. This is why we may want to look for better ways to obfuscate our code.
```js
console.log('HTB JavaScript Deobfuscation Module');

// Packed Code
eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d){e=function(c){return c};if(!''.replace(/^/,String)){while(c--){d[c]=k[c]||c}k=[function(e){return d[e]}];e=function(){return'\\w+'};c=1};while(c--){if(k[c]){p=p.replace(new RegExp('\\b'+e(c)+'\\b','g'),k[c])}}return p}('5.4(\'3 2 1 0\');',6,6,'Module|Deobfuscation|JavaScript|HTB|log|console'.split('|'),0,{}))

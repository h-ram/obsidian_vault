A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is a secure and encrypted connection between your device and the internet. This is achieved by a VPN server that you connect to, all your packets pass through that server, and it will change the source IP address of those packets and set it as the server's IP Address, making it seem like your traffic is not coming from your real location.
- It routes your internet traffic through a remote server, masking your IP address and encrypting data to protect your online privacy and security.
- A VPN creates a **secure tunnel** between your device (computer, phone, tablet) and a VPN server. All your internet traffic passes through this tunnel, preventing others (hackers, ISPs, government agencies) from seeing your data.
#### **Step-by-Step Process of How a VPN Works:**
1. **You connect to a VPN client** (an app or software) on your device.
2. **The VPN client encrypts your data** before sending it to the VPN server.
3. **Your internet traffic is routed through the VPN server**, which assigns you a new IP address.
4. **The VPN server decrypts your data** and sends it to the destination website.
5. **The website sees the VPN server’s IP address**, not your real one, keeping your identity hidden.
6. **Data returning from the website is encrypted again** by the VPN before reaching you.

### **Example of How a VPN Works in Real Life**
- **Without a VPN:**
    - You connect directly to a website (e.g., Google.com).
    - Your ISP (Internet Service Provider) and others can **see your IP address** and track your activities.
    - If you're on public Wi-Fi (like a coffee shop), hackers can intercept your data.
- **With a VPN:**
    - You connect to a VPN server in another country (e.g., the UK).
    - Your real IP is hidden, and your connection is encrypted.
    - Websites and ISPs **see the VPN’s IP, not yours**, protecting your identity.
    - Even on public Wi-Fi, your data is safe from hackers.
### **Types of VPNs**
1. **Remote Access VPN:**
    Remote Access VPN permits a user to connect to a private network and access all its services and resources remotely. The connection between the user and the private network occurs through the Internet and the connection is secure and private. Remote Access VPN is useful for home users and business users both. An employee of a company, while he/she is out of station, uses a VPN to connect to his/her company’s private network and remotely access files and resources on the private network. Private users or home users of VPN, primarily use VPN services to bypass regional restrictions on the Internet and access blocked websites. Users aware of Internet security also use VPN services to enhance their Internet security and privacy.
	1. **Client-based VPNs**: requires the use of client software to establish the VPN connection. Once connected, the user's host will work mostly as if it were connected directly to the company network and will be able to access any resources (applications, hosts, subnets, etc.)
	2. **SSL-based VPNs**: uses the web browser as the VPN client without the need for the end user to install or use any specialized software.
2. **Site-to-Site VPN:**
    A Site-to-Site VPN is also called as Router-to-Router VPN and is commonly used in the large companies. Companies or organizations, with branch offices in different locations, use Site-to-site VPN to connect the network of one office location to the network at another office location. 
	- **Intranet based VPN:** When several offices of the same company are connected using Site-to-Site VPN type, it is called as Intranet based VPN.
	- **Extranet based VPN:** When companies use Site-to-site VPN type to connect to the office of another company, it is called as Extranet based VPN.
### **Popular VPN Providers:**
- **Paid VPNs (More Secure & Reliable)**: ExpressVPN, NordVPN, CyberGhost, Surfshark.

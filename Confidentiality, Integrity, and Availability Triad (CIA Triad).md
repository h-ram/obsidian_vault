The **CIA Triad** is a fundamental model in  [[Information Security (InfoSec)|InfoSec]] that stands for **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**. These three principles form the cornerstone of information security practices, guiding how organizations protect data and systems.
### 1. Confidentiality
**Objective**: Protect data from unauthorized access and disclosure.
- **Ensures** that sensitive information is only accessible to those with authorized access.
- **Techniques**:
    - Encryption (e.g., AES, RSA)
    - Access Control (e.g., user permissions, role-based access control)
    - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
    - Data Masking
**Example**: Protecting patient records in a hospital so that only authorized medical staff can view them.
### 2. Integrity
**Objective**: Ensure data accuracy and trustworthiness.
- **Ensures** that data remains unchanged and uncorrupted, both in storage and during transmission.
- **Techniques**:
    - Hashing (e.g., SHA-256)
    - Checksums
    - Digital Signatures
    - Version Control
**Example**: Verifying that a financial transaction has not been altered during processing.
### 3. Availability
**Objective**: Ensure reliable access to data and systems when needed.
- **Ensures** that systems, networks, and data are accessible to authorized users without interruption.
- **Techniques**:
    - Redundant systems (e.g., backup servers)
    - Load Balancing
    - Disaster Recovery Plans
    - Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Protection
**Example**: Ensuring that an e-commerce website remains online during a peak shopping season.
### Common Applications
- **Network Security**: Firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), VPNs.
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, data loss prevention (DLP), access control.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup solutions, failover systems, incident response plans.
### Example Scenario
A bankâ€™s online platform:
- **Confidentiality**: Encrypts customer data and requires MFA for login.
- **Integrity**: Uses digital signatures for transaction verification.
- **Availability**: Implements redundant servers and DDoS protection to ensure uptime.
